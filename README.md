<h2>Summary of "Predicting NVIDIA Stock Price with Python"</h2>

<h3>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h3>
<p>
The notebook begins with data acquisition, where the NVIDIA stock price data is loaded into a DataFrame using <code>pandas</code>. The initial step includes displaying the first and last few rows of the DataFrame to understand the dataset's structure. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes exploratory data analysis (EDA), where line plots of the stock's closing prices over time are created. Additional statistical features such as rolling means and standard deviations are computed to understand the stock's trends and volatility. A check for missing values ensures the dataset's completeness, and feature engineering steps introduce lag features and rolling statistics to enrich the data for model training.

<h3>Model Selection and Training</h3>
<p>
For model selection, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is chosen due to its effectiveness in time series prediction tasks. The LSTM model is constructed using the <code>Sequential</code> API from <code>Keras</code>, with layers added to capture sequential dependencies in the stock price data. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. The training process includes early stopping to prevent overfitting, monitoring validation loss to determine the optimal number of training epochs.

<h3>Evaluation and Prediction</h3>
<p>
Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated on both the training and testing datasets. Predictions are made using the trained LSTM model, and the predicted values are transformed back to the original scale for comparison. The evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and testing datasets, providing insights into the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
</p>

<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
The final section focuses on visualizing the results. Actual vs. predicted stock prices are plotted to visually assess the model's performance. Separate plots are created for training and testing periods, with clear markers indicating actual values and predictions. The visualization includes annotations for the train/test split and other relevant details to enhance interpretability. This step provides a comprehensive view of how well the model captures the stock's trends and patterns, highlighting areas of accurate prediction and potential discrepancies.
